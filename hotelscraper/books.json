However, we could not sleep at night as there was constant yelling and cussing of people all night long. We were on the fifth floor and it felt like the people were sharing our room, they  were so loud! The hotel could also use some blackout shades or curtains, that is more a personal preference. Staff were wonderful!",

I don’t think there are renovations being done at the moment (June 2024) but we were on the top floor and in an old style room. I was generally clean but dirty marks on the pillows. The bathroom however, was really smelly  and not pleasant to use. Top floor not for those with vertigo!! \nThat said it was a great location and staff were lovely. I expect the renovated rooms will be lovely (and more pricey). Value for money in the room we had was good.",

We were there for four days and we felt the size wasn’t adequate. Our oversight as was the lack of a television but in a room priced at over £300 per night I would expect a television. We spend very little time in the room but consider it a treat to catch up on the news from the bed.  I also would have liked better clothes storage facilities and less single use plastic- a mini fridge would have helped with this with the milk situation. Five coat hangers on a wall was not adequate with open storage general use shelves for four days of clothes for two people.  The lack of any towel rails  and only one hook in the whole bathroom was annoying and inconvenient. Our towels were changed needlessly because they were damp rather than dirty.  Unfortunately the shower had a bad drain smell too.  However, the room was clean and tidy. We did have a kettle with one breakfast tea bag, one peppermint tea bag and a coffee bag each. The bed was comfortable and the shower was spacious.  Our room was at the corner of the second floor and was quiet with a great view of the Victoria docks and convenient for the DLR, the Emirates cable car and the Elizabeth line.  The reception staff were always friendly and helpful. ",

Rudely demanded of photo ID and notified a charge of £250 would be taken for evidence of drug use. I am a professional business customer and this was so poorly judged by staff.

Was told I should walk to a cash point in the rain with little direction as to where the nearest cash point was. It was pouring with rain, getting dark and I was a lone female customer. Receptionist replied that she was happy to cancel my booking if I preferred . The day of the queen's return to buckingham Palace with no chance of securing an alternative hotel. After returning with the cash I was given a key card with no holder with room number on. I made my way to my room after clarifying room number twice, staff area doors in corridors left open exposing dirty laundry, key card device broken off door, semen stains on wall, public hair on top of bed sheets. Mortified, so much so I didn't get under the sheets for fear of what I would find. Tried to have a wash to find the shower gel had been topped up 3 quarters with water from a previous guest.

She was so rude as I was simply asking her a tower for my child 3 times, but she just keep shouting to me later later and then she didn’t providing anything.   After that I just told her about the room’s problems. There were so many flies inside, the shower was smelly, no towers, and it sinking everywhere, but she’s just denied and said that was the standard room. And they said there’s no service room like cleaning. They just clean the room after 1 week.   When I was here I can see, that wasn’t only me. There were so many customers made the complaints as the rooms weren’t same as pictures on the website. 1 lady was crying as the staff refused to cancel for her and said she doesn’t care. If she want to cancel, she will loose her money. Other man got pissed of with the same situation of the room was completely different with what they saw online.   They even forced me to check out at 9am instead of 11:00 as normal even though our room is prepaid but it took forever for check in as they said there was no booking for us. Many times I asked them please double check, but the manager asked us to leave otherwise they will call the police. That was so horrible when I got a young child, and that was late night.   I would advise everyone not to book in advance, better not to stay.",

This is the worst hotel I've ever used there must be better for the price. Door is left open in the night and reception is rarely manned.

Last time when I arrived they told me I had been upgraded to a bigger room with a complimentary breakfast (that was with ***********), but no such luck this time. Room was a good size with a sofa next to the bed. Got a good night’s sleep and the bed was extremely comfortable. Didn’t bother going to the bar but instead visited a pub over the road and went to a nearby Wetherspoons for breakfast rather than paying £20. The swimming pool was great, not too busy when I used it, although I noticed people were ignoring the no photography/phones rule and one woman was even taking selfies in the water! The location is great, close to the Tower of London and Tower Hill tube. Definitely one of my go-to hotels when in London.",

The spa facilities are great. You can use the steam room, sauna, pool and the jacuzzi which I loved so much, also use rhe gym and pay for spa treatments which is reasonable priced. The shower in the room wow was lovely and hot wnd powerful. I spent so long in there i didnt wanna get out lol. This was a well deserved time for us both. We will defo be coming back in the future. \nEasy to find as well. There is also a parking g place round the corner which was not far at all a 1 min walk back to the hotel. Weatherspoons was next door also. \nThank you all for a wonderful stay. See you all real soon.",

There is no place at all to take clothes from the luggage. Even not so easy to pass through the room because all the room space was the bed with few centimeters free space to pass.   We really didn’t want some big room, because we came to be outside most of the time but every morning was challenging to dress up. Coffee machine also was out of service.  There is paid service to store luggage for 12 hours after check out, and I have not any problem to pay for this service, but I expected there is toilet when we came to get our luggage before we leave to airport.

However, I was disappointed by the outdated interior of the hotel. The lights is broken. Additionally, the staff's attitude left much to be desired. When I inquired about a broken light, their response was dismissive and lacked hospitality. Saying that’s it’s normal, their main ceiling lights is not functional. Furthermore, when I asked for recommendations on where to purchase slippers since the hotel didn't provide them, the staff's response was unhelpful, simply replying: “just go out to find a nearby shop, any shop that has slippers.”",

Our room did have a view of the construction but we expected that as we are in the middle of Manchester and it was not a problem at all . The breakfast was beautiful unfortunately I didn't get the gentleman's name who was clearing the tables but he was so nice lastly I would like to give mo from housekeeping a massive shout out our room was spotless and he even gave me a kit kat 😀 what stands out about this hotel is the staff and I mean all the staff shine they all greet you with smiles and I know how hard that can be for a full shift 😀  can't wait to come back thank you ",

EVERY member of staff we encountered were very friendly, helpful and courteous - for me this goes a long way, even if the facilities are not good, which they definitely were here.   The hotel is spotlessly clean, the room has every convenience you need and the breakfast was so vast in choice, not to mention that the coffee was superb!  We had intended to go into town for a meal before our concert, but as it was raining and there was also a football match on that night, we ate at the hotel and was pleasantly surprised at the quality (was expecting the usual fast food burgers or pizza).  Definitely will return next time we go to Manchester.",

Walked in to the reception desk to be welcomed by a staff member on the phone speaking with a guest that was complaining die to their room not being cleaned. Once the call was finished he checked me in very quickly and not welcoming at all. I was not given any information about breakfast times or any other amenities. Basically paid for the room and got given the room key and directed to the elevator as if I was inconveniencing him. Got into the room looked beautiful, however was surrounded by a construction site outside my window. When heeting ready for bed wanted to wash my face so took the smaller towel in the cupboard to see that it had been used and looked like there was mascara or a black stain from previous guests. Then I saw that they do room service so decided to give them a call as I was thirsty and no drinks were offered in the room. I called them 6 times without any answer and eventually gave up. Unfortunately will not be returning as the price I paid I expected at least better service from staff and cleanliness.",

On arrival there were two cars taking up the designated spaces without displaying a blue badge. When my wife went to reception the red faced manageress came and moved her car saying there was no other spaces available. So she moved her white car and we parked. The receptionist questioned why we couldn’t park elsewhere when we need the space to get a wheelchair out and open the door fully. Unbelievable!!",

You get what you pay for, so its not the Carlton Ritz, but great for a stopover and I always find the price very reasonable.  Its a strange mix of offices on some floor, rooms on the others.  Bit of an unsual set up for a hotel, but it works.  Free car park too.",

It seems poor practice to sell rooms when they knowingly have issues.   - Marks on pillowcases.  - Hole in the duvet cover, leaving a corner of the duvet to poke out.  - Dirty water glasses.  - Smears across bedroom mirror.   - Carpet is marked in many places (you wouldn’t want to walk barefoot).  - The toilet seat is only anchored to one side (so it moves constantly).  - Enclosed shower leaks into the bathroom.  - Shaver plug charged toothbrush intermittently.  - Not sure if the extractor worked; as the bathroom mirrors took a long time to clear after showering.  - The second keycard didn’t work.  - Aircon felt non-existent but was still noisy.  - No net or privacy filters on windows, so you either had to draw the blackout curtains completely or be seen by the adjacent hotel’s occupants.   Room flaws:   - The rainfall shower was terrific, but the small cubical made it impossible to move away from the water to apply soap/shampoo.  - The bedside light switches were too far away to reach from the bed.  - Windows looked double sealed, but you could still hear a local bar and their customers at 4 am from the third floor.  -   Breakfast:  - A little chaotic! Staff tried their best, but they seemed to struggle with replacing food.  - Cooked breakfast buffet was boiled to an inch of its life, no flavour in anything.  The pros:   - very good size bathroom, with separate shower and bath. Modern looking.  - a good central location.  - local parking discount (25%)  302 Saturday 25th Sep",

Cannot fault the customer care but there were a couple of small things that weren't great - the toilet in the second room didn't flush well at all but after being upgraded we weren't going to make an issue of it so said nothing  Only other thing was the lack of light in the room - we had a side room so no natural light got in. There were a couple of lamps on the desk but far too dull - not great when trying to do hair and make up for a wedding!

It is near the attractions, and the local store helped me grab something to eat easily.  By the way, I had booked a room for 3 people, and they provided an extra bed, but I got only 2 towels, so I had to request another towel each night during my stay. However, the breakfast was various kinds of food. Not too bad.",

One tip, if you want to charge your phone and use it while lying in bed, bring an extra long phone charger cable, as the only socket in the room is under the TV, which is in the corner of the room Its a maybe, that I will stay again. I got it for a great price. Overall, happy with stay. It is the basic of basic hotels! Heard from other that the tram can be loud, but I never heard it.

My evening was ruined because of lack of information on their website. I had plans at Manchester academy at 7.30. firstly I couldn't park because the car park was full. It was difficult enough getting to the place because of roadworks. I was then directed to another car park. But again because of road closures I or the staff had no idea how to get to it. Then when I had got checked in and parked I couldn't get a bus from the hotel because the road was closed and buses where not coming past. I ended up driving around Manchester for an hour trying to find somewhere to park. Which cost me an arm and a leg. The noise in the morning from building work was ridiculous. If this information had been put on the website I wouldn't have booked. My night was a disaster",

No easy access for guests to rooms - they nearly walked halfway back to Birmingham to get to their room in to another building via lifts, steps and ramps.  No clear signs for steps/ramps which my mum nearly fell over on.  Stained and dirty carpets/walls.  Bathroom in room did not lock.  Not hotel’s fault - break in during the middle of the night which left my mum unable to sleep.  Absolute disgrace overall!",

Free parking, now there's a rare thing,  and really friendly staff throughout.  Would I stay here again, absolutely, without hesitation.  ",

Although I had read some bad reviews I thought I would just wait and make up my own mind. The staff are really friendly, the rooms are nice and clean and it’s in a great location. Not 5 star but it’s great for a short stay. I think it’s admirable that they are housing people who have fallen on hard times, my only complaint is that I don’t think they should be put on the same floors as paying guests.",

Just beyond (in a comfortable walking distance through the Liverpool One shopping area - with flagship department stores and smaller favorites) is the river Mersey where you’ll explore the city’s cultural and heritage sites, the famous ferry, the Albert Dock, MS Arena and the iconic Three Graces.The Ropewalks area is a fascinating central location, given its name from the many roperie streets – long and straight for the craft of rope making. A testament to the 19th century Liverpool heyday of maritime greatness. With 102 listed buildings Ropewalks is a handsome mixture of merchant houses, counting houses, and warehouses where breweries, timber yards, cooperages, potteries, foundries, sugar refining, and roperies flourished.",

Luckily we could get a coffee from the bar.   Some feedback - it would be good if the hotel could invest in a proper Italian barista coffee machine as some of the guests do not like Nescafé type coffee!   A proper coffee with coffee beans and made at the time  is much appreciated !",

Easy stroll from the hotel to the venue but the direct bridge on Google Maps is part of a private estate so is locked. It's just a short detour though. Everything you'd expect from the chain - clean, nice breakfast, lovely staff. The door to the wardrobe doubles as the door to the bathroom - I was on my own and it took a little while to work it out! it's a 10 minute walk to the City Centre and maybe 20 minutes to Lime St Station (up a big hill - get a taxi for under £5)",

Right on the pedestrian street and walking distance to the bund and restaurants. Hotel had comfortable beds, and we got an amazing room at the top most floor with views of the bund! Sadly we spent all day out that when we got back the lights of the bund were always off when we got back but that’s not the hotels fault. Breakfast was good, had the local delicacies that I enjoyed. Staff were so sweet to bring a cake for my daughter’s birthday and it was the most delicious cake ever so smooth dark chocolate yum! I will be coming back for more! \nToiletries were good and hotel was very accommodating for anything we needed. I will be back to stay here again when I’m Shanghai!",

We’ve stayed at the Radisson multiple times as it’s been our hotel of choice for business and pleasure for many (15+) years. This stay was specifically for business.\n\nUpon check-in we were told that our room had no window, even for almost 900 CNY that we paid on Trip. And that payment was only a guarantee. Fine. So, we agreed to pay an additional 100 CNY to have a window.\n\nThen, we were also told that we needed to pay (WeChat) 1500 CNY and that would include the cost of the room rate and the deposit. No sincere explanation or apology by the person at the check-in counter, just a lot of uncomfortable laughing and “pay now, pay now.” We felt like we were being cheated even though this was normal policy.\n\nTo be fair, the room given had an amazing view. We were very satisfied and had begun to think the worst was behind us.\n\nWe ordered room service that included wonton (dumplings) soup, a classic Caesar salad, and a margherita pizza. The wonton soup was great, but the margherita pizza was barely passable, and the classic Caesar salad was an abomination. Hands down, it was the worst Caesar salad we had ever had. Tiny bacon bits, smelly yellow oil, and old lettuce. We ate two bites and quickly placed it outside in the hallway where it sat until 10:00am the next day. Note: you can only order premium (expensive) bottled water and we were told that they couldn’t give us any more “regular” bottled water even if we said we’d pay for it.\n\nAt night, the staff at the fitness center acted as if we were disturbing them when we asked basic questions. A total lack of hospitality that should be on display at a 5-star hotel. We really began to dislike our experience at this point because it became quite evident that nobody really cared. To again be fair, however, the male staff who was on duty in the next morning, was sincere and polite. A welcoming contrast from the evening before.\n\nBut then at brunch, the three young men who were running the egg and omelet station were horribly loud and rude. Like everything was a big joke to them – and it got to the point where we just walked away even after we had tried to order.\n\nAfter brunch, probably the biggest disappointment was that we found out that the Business Center was closed. We had scheduled an important meeting at the hotel and needed to print and prepare some items. We were told that we could only print if we emailed the documents to a hotel email. This was not going to happen so we created a little fuss and a polite manager suddenly appeared and handled everything. That was nice. But the damage was done.\n\nAfter this situation, we made the decision that this would be our last time staying at the Radisson.\n\nLastly, after more than 24 hours, the guarantee was only refunded after we called and spoke to a customer service representative at Trip who was very helpful.",

Linked to 新世界城 shopping mall with lots of restaurants, a cinema and Madame Tussaud museum. Services are great- must compliment the staff. Rooms esp the mid to lower floors ones are a bit torn out. The newer renovated ones (superior rooms) are located on the upper floors and they are far better. Overall, great value for money.",

I would personally choose another hotel if smoke is allowed in the hotel and definitely if there is smoking allowed on my floor.

If you’re not bothered by these issues, it’s worth considering. Keep in mind that the hotel is basic, suitable mainly for budget travelers looking for a short stay.

The window in the quadruple room I booked is very small and can only be opened a little because all corridors have fire doors. So the room ventilation is very poor. It would be a disaster if you encounter a tenant who is not very hygienic. There is a queue when the bathroom is busy, and the water in some bathrooms is not hot enough. After staying there for two days, I started to get familiar with it. All the staff are relatively friendly, and there is a lot of customer traffic, with many families and student groups checking in. There is a supermarket next to it where you can buy coffee and food. It is also convenient to take public transportation to various attractions.\n\nFacilities: It's pretty good, but some guests don't take good care of it and the bathroom is often dirty. Especially the public bathroom in the lobby on the first floor.\nEnvironment: The sound of walking on the floor and the sound of doors opening and closing is noisy, but it is within the tolerance range.\nFacilities: The wifi and terrace are very good, so you can sunbathe and surf the Internet in summer. The indoor lobby guest seating area is large and comfortable.",

After staying there for two days, I started to get familiar with it. All the staff are relatively friendly, and there is a lot of customer traffic, with many families and student groups checking in. There is a supermarket next to it where you can buy coffee and food. It is also convenient to take public transportation to various attractions.\n\nFacilities: It's pretty good, but some guests don't take good care of it and the bathroom is often dirty. Especially the public bathroom in the lobby on the first floor.\nEnvironment: The sound of walking on the floor and the sound of doors opening and closing is noisy, but it is within the tolerance range.\nFacilities: The wifi and terrace are very good, so you can sunbathe and surf the Internet in summer. The indoor lobby guest seating area is large and comfortable.",

However, first of all, check-in isn't until 4pm which is later than any hostel I've ever stayed at, and there's not even really any place inside to wait until then so you can't go inside until after that time (unless you want to pay extra to go earlier).  Second, you have to pay 10 extra pounds, in cash, for a key and at least one of the staff members was pretty rude. I accidentally forgot my key to my room one day and then randomly a staff member shows up and yelled at me for waiting in the hallway for someone to come because no one at reception answered the door when I knocked to ask about a spare key.  Third of all, the area is kind of sketchy. Even though you can find homeless people scattered around the London metro area I was probably approached the most by homeless people either just outside of this hostel or on one of the nearby streets.  You also can't get refunded once you book and, for some reason, hostelworld said my recent trip there was cancelled (which is why I couldn't put this review on hostelworld).  Therefore, unless you're with a group of people and don't mind the most awful place to stay and/or you'd like to be within a 30-minute walk to Greenwich, I would highly highly highly NOT recommend this place (especially as a solo traveller)!",

Get out !”. He never listened to the customer and just shouted like a mafia. And it had too complex procedure by internet before check in, which wasn’t normally necessary, and the twin room was like the prison. We couldn’t open the windows and too stinky. I asked the shouting guy to open it. He just said “If you don’t go outside, I open.” I talked with him to know his background and he said that he is from Italy and Romania (this information is to specialize him)  Many people write about this hotel, and the worst review are truth and I asked the travel company to delete the information because this hotel’s introduction is the fraud and fake.   At the last, I attache the picture when I open the window. There was the fixed board written “close”.This is the truth.",
